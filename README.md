A program for playing Pong on an LED array.

A 60x30 LED array is connected to a Teensy 3.x running the Pong game SW. This
uses the OctoWS2811 library to drive the LED array. Two MMA8452Q
accelerometers provide the user-input, and are accelerometers are accessed
using Sparkfun's library.

The accelerometers are attached to a plank that's balanced over a large
PVC pipe. The x-axis is aligned along the length of the plant, perpendicular
to the pipe, and controls whether that user's bat moves up, down, or not at
all.
